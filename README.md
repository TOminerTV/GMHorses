# GMHorses
Spigot player horses plugin for Minecraft Version 1.16.

No longer maintained in any way. The code can be used freely.

Supported by https://projekt-eleven.eu. The gaming community with ❤️!

DISCLAIMER: This code is definitely not perfect, that's one of the reasons why this code is freely available. You will find bad code, like endlessly nested if statements. For this reason, the code should only be used as a hint if you want to write a plugin that takes up this idea.
